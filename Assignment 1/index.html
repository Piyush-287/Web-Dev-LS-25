The streets were all wet.A vagabond entered the arena of warriors.The hallways were all busy by but still the splash of water can be heared and peircing through your ears as you enter the campus . The Sky was still in anger of unknown .The traveller said goodbye to his parents waving his hands and pouring his heart in that one moment as he was first time going to be alone for maybe a week , a month, or forever ... As the night falls , the wanderer slept on his bed wondering all the various things going around him waiting for a new sunrise ... </p>
